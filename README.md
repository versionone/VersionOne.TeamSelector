##What to run from the command line:
webpack : for building once for development
webpack -p : for building once for production (minification)
webpack --watch : for continuous incremental build
webpack -d : to include source maps
webpack --colors : for making things pretty

npm run start : for opening index.html at localhost:3001 using http-server

##Thought processes / hurdles / future notes:
At what level is the specific state managed?
Example: TeamCard.jsx needs to manage the state that display what is in the input box
Then, a call is passed up to TeamDisplay.jsx to change the backend state that contains all the teams that are being stored

How to "delete" or not render a component
Instead of trying to use ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode() just change the state that you render from to not include the data
Ohhhhhhh :O

When does a variable need to be global, in the state of the object, or in the props?
Global is a last resort for when React queues an update state but does not update immediately
Props are generally passed down from other objects
State is directly related to the existance of the object
